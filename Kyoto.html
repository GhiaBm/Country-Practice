    <h2 class="TitlesOthers">Kyoto</h2>
    <h3 class="textintro">
      Kyoto is Japan in a nutshell. It's the cultural and historical heart of
      the country. It's the best place in all Japan to experience traditional
      temples, shrines, gardens, geisha, shops, restaurants and festivals, some
      of which have been designated collectively as a World Heritage Site by
      UNESCO. Kyoto was first settled in the 7th century and in 794, Emperor
      Kammu relocated the capital of Japan from nearby Nagaoka-kyo to Kyoto,
      which at the time was called “Heian-kyo” and was built as a scale replica
      of the then capital of the Tang empire, Chang'an (modern day Xian).
      Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kiyomizu-dera,
      Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, and Kyoto Tower. Seeing that Kyoto was the capital
      city of Japan for over 1,000 years, it won't be a surprise that the city
      is filled with history. Especially since large parts of the city are very
      well preserved, Kyoto shows what Japan used to look like. This gives Kyoto
      the title of the cultural capital of Japan.

      <h3 class="text2">
        There is a legend that in AD768, the first of the four gods of
        Kasugataisha Shrine travelled all the way from Ibaraki Prefecture North
        of Tokyo, to Mt. Mikasa in Nara, on a white deer. Thereafter, deer were
        considered sacred, and killing one was punishable by death. Sika deer
        flourish in Nara because they are protected, highly managed, and
        generously fed by throngs of camera-wielding tourists. They're
        considered sacred because of their significance in the ancient Shinto
        religion.

      <h3 class="text2">
        It is famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle
        a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the
        wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and
        belongs to the shrine grounds. The legend goes, a rice cake was shot
        into the air, which turned into a swan and flew away, eventually landing
        on a peak of a mountain, where rice grew (an auspicious omen in Japan).
        This led to the deity Inari Okami (the god of rice) being enshrined on
        the plateau and the start of Fushimi Inari Taisha
