      <h2 class="TitlesOthers">Japan's Culture</h2>
      <h3 class="textintro1">
        Japan has a rich, colorful culture dating back to the country's
        prehistoric period known as the Jōmon period between 14,000 and 300 BCE.
        The culture and traditions of Japan are unique because of its
        island-nation geography as well as its isolation from the outside world
        during the Tokugawa shogunate regime While its many traditions and
        cultural landmarks persist, Japan is also one of the leading economic
        and technological centres of the world. Ancient gods and traditional
        customs sit side by side with cutting edge technologies and trendy pop
        culture, and there is always something new to experience on a visit.

        They are traditional Japanese entertainers who act as hostesses during
        meals, banquets and other occasions at high-quality Japanese-style
        restaurants or Japanese hotels (ryokan) by performing classical
        instruments and dances. A Maiko, also called Hangyoku (meaning
        “half-jewel”), is an apprentice Geisha.

      </ul>
      <h3 class="text2">
        The traditional Japanese diet is naturally rich in various nutrients,
        including fiber, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins A, C,
        and E ( 4 ). Vegetables contribute to the nutrient density of this diet
        and are often cooked in dashi, a dried fish and sea vegetable based
        stock. The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on
        rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal
        ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and
        vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also
        served raw as sashimi or in sushi. A Meal Should Include All Five
        Tastes: In addition to bitter, sour, salt, and sweet, Japan rounds off
        their list of five taste sensations with umami, which translates roughly
        to “savory”

        Manga refers to all comics of Japanese origin. Anime can be thought of
        as manga's onscreen counterpart. Themes of manga and anime include
        romance, action adventure, science fiction. Some of the more popular
        manga and anime series are AstroBoy, Doraemon, Dragon Ball and Spirited
        Away. Manga and anime are not just literature creations or television
        broadcasts. They represent the culture of an entire country; they are
        Japan's window to the world. Through them, cultural aspects of the land
        of the rising sun, such as gastronomy or language, are reflected.
