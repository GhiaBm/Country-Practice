    <h3 class="textintro">
      Tokyo is known for iconic landmarks like the Tokyo Skytree and Shibuya
      Crossing. It's famous for its sakura tree-lined streets, shrines and
      temples, its otaku culture and wonderful cuisine, and its world-class
      transport system. It's a quirky city that combines millennia-old
      traditions with futuristic technology. In fact, Tokyo has been called the
      safest city in the world! The reputation of being safe ironically can make
      Tokyo less safe if you let your guard down. As a crowded city, there is a
      risk of petty crimes, but it is still quite low in comparison to many
      other cities. Even if you've lived in Tokyo for years, you'll always find
      something new to do there, with its countless museums, attractions, parks,
      shops and so much more. As far as dining, there are simply thousands of
      cafes and restaurants to choose from and shopping is also a fun pastime to
      enjoy here.

      <h3 class="text2">
        Meiji Jingu is one of Japan's most popular shrines. In the first days of
        the New Year, the shrine regularly welcomes more than three million
        visitors for the year's first prayers (hatsumode), more than any other
        shrine or temple in the country. The Meiji period that followed the
        Restoration was an era of major political, economic, and social change
        in Japan. The reforms enacted during the Meiji emperor's rule brought
        about the modernization and Westernization of the country and paved the
        way for Japan to become a major international power.

      </ul>
      <h3 class="text2">
        Sensoji is the oldest temple in Tokyo, boasting over 1300 years of
        history. Located in the popular sightseeing area of Asakusa, this temple
        is especially famous for its large red lantern hanging at the entrance
        gate called Kaminarimon. Legend has it that in 628 AD, fishermen found a
        statue of Kannon in the Sumida River, and Sensoji Temple was built to
        enshrine it. Throughout its long history, the Main Hall has been
        destroyed countless times and rebuilt from the donations of people from
        all over Japan.
